// Old code. Does the same as above, but uses keyframe animation instead
// of transitions. Transitions are superior for this application since they
// hold memory as to what state the animation was in, so that you could, for
// example, scroll the svg out of view, have it go through half its disappear
// animation, and then scroll it back into view, so that it does its appear
// animation already halfway appeared. Keyframes can't manage this easily.
